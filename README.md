# Decentralized
##Decentralized p2p cryptographically secure chat client/server combination

**The Log**

3/28 - Can't get pycrypto installed. Fucking dependencies

3/29 - Switching to pycryptodome instead. Got it working. Use comments and a log file, idiot

3/30 - Found good examples for Gui and Server. The gui looks like shit but, beggers can't be choosers. Having a hard time
combining into one

3/30 - Have working proof of concept of sharing a key securely using RSA and then utilizing the pre-shared key to encrypt data between two people

3/31 - Combined the server and chat. Now I need to clean up the code as much as I can
so that I can implment the ledger

3/31 - Do I need the ledger?


**TODO LIST**

~~Figure out text descryption for messages~~

~~Figure out why the web keys aren't the same~~

~~Combine Client and Server successfully. Fails: 3 times~~

Research and implement distributed ledger

On second thought, I don't think i need this.


**Task list**
- [x] Crypto
- [x] Merge client / server (calling this a node)
- [ ] Ledger for clients
- [ ] Add crypto into gui
