# Decentralized
##Decentralized p2p cryptographically secure chat client/server combination

**The Log**
3/28 - Can't get pycrypto installed. Fucking dependencies
3/29 - Switching to pycryptodome instead. Got it working. Use comments and a log file, idiot
3/30 - Found good examples for Gui and Server. The gui looks like shit but, beggers can't be choosers. Having a hard time
combining into one

~~Mistakes Made~~
3/28 Used pycrypto instead of pycryptodome


**TODO LIST**
~~Figure out text descryption for messages~~
Figure out why the web keys aren't the same
Combine Client and Server successfully.
