# Decentralized
##Decentralized p2p cryptographically secure chat client/server combination

**The Log**
3/28 - Can't get pycrypto installed. Fucking dependencies
3/29 - Switching to pycryptodome instead. Got it working. Use comments and a log file, idiot
3/30 - Found good examples for Gui and Server. The gui looks like shit but, beggers can't be choosers. Having a hard time
combining into one
3/30 - Have working proof of concept of sharing a key securely using RSA and then utilizing the pre-shared key to encrypt data between two people

**TODO LIST**
~~Figure out text descryption for messages~~
~~Figure out why the web keys aren't the same~~
